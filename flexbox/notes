# topics to learn in flexbox :
# these properties are varies from containers and childrens 

- to make container flex (cmd: display: flex)
*(this makes container flex means get flexbox properties only apply for container)
*(default it makes children in row)
*(we can change it by flex-direction:column)



======= flex container properties are: ===========

@ flex-directions [column , column-reverse , row , row-reverse]

@ flex-wrap (this adjust wrapping of elements default : no-wrap) [wrap , no-wrap , wrap-reverse]

@ gap (gives gap between two childs) [row-gap , column-gap]

@ flex-flow (combines flex-direction and flex-wrap - flex-flow: wrap row)

@ justify-content (align items in x axis) [space-around , centre , space-between , flex-end]

@ align-items (align items in y-axis default:strech) [flex-start , flex-end , centre]

@ align-content (align items in y-axis more) [space-between , space-around , flex-start , flex-end ]




======== flex children properties are: ============

@ flex-grow (this take remaining space and adjust the space value of this decide which element grow fast) [flex-grow:1]

@ flex-shrink (this shrink fast and first and value decide which element shrink first) [flex-shrink : 1]

@ flex-basis (flex-basis changes the default main-axis height/width) [flex-basis:100px] 

@ flex (combine flex-grow ,flex-shrink , flex-basic) [flex : flex-grow flex-shrink flex-basis] [flex: 1 2 100px]

@ align self (align specific element aligns y axis) [align-self:flex-start]
